# Problem Set 2
**Using the procedure outlined in section 1 of the weekly handout, write a function to compute the inverse of a well-conditioned full-rank square matrix using co-factors. In order to compute the co-factors,  you may use built-in commands to compute the determinant. Your function should have the following signature: **  
B = myinverse(A)  
**where A is a matrix and B is its inverse and AxB = I. The off-diagonal elements of I should be close to zero, if not zero. Likewise, the diagonal elements should be close to 1, if not 1. Small numerical precision errors are acceptable but the function *myinverse* should be correct and must use co-factors and determinant of A to compute the inverse.**

``` {r}

A <- matrix(c(1,1,3,2,-1,5,-1,-2,4),nrow=3)
n <- nrow(A)
dimList <- seq(nrow(A))

# for all rows
for(i in dimList){

  # set row indices
  if (i==1){
    rows <- seq((i+1),n)
  } else if (i==n) {
    rows <- seq(1,(i-1))
  } else {
    rowa <- seq(1,(i-1))
    rowb <- seq((i+1),n)
    rows <- c(rowa,rowb)
  }
  
  # for all columns
  for(j in dimList){

    # set col indices
    if (j==1){
      cols <- seq((j+1),n)
    } else if (j==n) {
      cols <- seq(1,(j-1))
    } else {
      cola <- seq(1,(j-1))
      colb <- seq((j+1),n)
      cols <- c(cola,colb)
    }
  
    finalVal <- det(A[rows,cols])
    print(finalVal)
