# Problem Set 2
**Using the procedure outlined in section 1 of the weekly handout, write a function to compute the inverse of a well-conditioned full-rank square matrix using co-factors. In order to compute the co-factors,  you may use built-in commands to compute the determinant. Your function should have the following signature: **  
B = myinverse(A)  
**where A is a matrix and B is its inverse and AxB = I. The off-diagonal elements of I should be close to zero, if not zero. Likewise, the diagonal elements should be close to 1, if not 1. Small numerical precision errors are acceptable but the function *myinverse* should be correct and must use co-factors and determinant of A to computer the inverse.**
