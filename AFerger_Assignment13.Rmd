## Problem 1
**Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below.**
$$\int 4e^{-7x}dx$$

## Solution 
Let $u=-7x$ and $du = -7dx$. Therefore, $4dx = -\frac{4}{7}du$.  
By $u$ substitution: 
$$\int -\frac{4}{7}e^{u}dx$$
$$-\frac{4}{7} \int e^{u}dx$$
$$-\frac{4}{7} e^{u} + C$$

Substituting back in for $u$, we get: 
$$-\frac{4}{7} e^{-7x} + C$$

## Problem 2
**Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of $\frac{dN}{dt} = - \frac{3150}{t^4} - 220$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where $t$ is the number pf days since treatment began. Find a function $N(t)$ to estimate the level of contamination if the level after day 1 was $6,530$ bacteria per cubic centimeter.**

## Solution
We know that $\frac{dN}{dt} = N'(t)$ so in order to solve for $N(t)$, we must take the integral.
$$N(t) = \int - \frac{3150}{t^4} - 220 dt$$
$$N(t) = \frac{3150}{3t^3} - 220t + C$$
$$N(t) = \frac{1050}{t^3} - 220t + C$$

In order to solve for $C$, we will use the fact that $N(1) = 6530$.
$$N(1) = 6530= \frac{1050}{1^3} - 220(1) + C$$
$$6530= 1050 - 220 + C$$
$$C = 5700$$

Therefore, we know that:
$$N(t) = \frac{1050}{t^3} - 220t+ 5700$$

## Problem 3
**Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is $f(x) = 2x - 9$.**

## Solution
$$\int_{4.5}^{8.5}x 2x - 9 dx$$
$$= x^2 - 9x \Big|_{4.5}^{8.5}$$
$$= (8.5^2 - 9(8.5)) - (4.5^2 - 9(4.5))$$
$$= (72.25 - 76.5) - (20.25 - 40.5)$$
$$= -4.25 - -20.25$$
$$= 16$$

## Problem 4
**Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations: **
$$y = x^2 - 2x - 2, y = x + 2$$

## Solution
First, we will see where the two functions intersect by setting them equal to each other:
$$x^2 - 2x - 4 = x + 2$$
$$x^2 - 3x -4 = 0$$
$$(x+1)(x-4)= 0$$
$$x = -1, x = 4$$

To find the area in between the two curves, we can use the following:
$$A = \int_{a}^{b} (upper function) - (lower function) dx$$

We can see from plotting the curves that our upper function is $y = x + 2$ and our lower function is $y = x^2 - 2x - 2$. 

```{r}
y1 <- function(x){x^2 - (2*x) - 2}
y2 <- function(x){x + 2}

curve(y1, from = -1, to = 4)
curve(y2, from = -1, to = 4, add = TRUE)

```


We know our bounds are $[-1,4]$, so we can plug this information into our formula and solve:
$$\int_{-1}^{4} (x + 2) - (x^2 - 2x - 2) dx$$
$$\int_{-1}^{4} - x^2 + 3x + 4 dx$$


Integrating and plugging in our bounds we get: 
```{r}

fun <- function(x) (3*x) + 4 - x^2
integrate(fun,-1,4)

```

## Problem 5
**A beauty supply store expects to sell $110$ flat irons during the next year. It costs $\$3.75$ to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of $\$8.25$ for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.**

## Solution
First, we will need to define a function for the inventory cost that takes into account the storage costs and order costs. 

* We will define $n$ as the number of irons per order.
* We will define *Inventory Cost = Storage Cost + Order Cost*
* We will assume that on average, $\frac{n}{2}$ flat irons are in storage. Therefore, storage cost will be defined as the cost to store 1 flat iron per year times the average number of irons in storage: *Storage Cost = 3.75* * $\frac{n}{2}$
* Order cost will be defined as the flat rate per cost times the number of order: *Order Cost = 8.25 * * $\frac{110}{n}$
* Therefore, *Inventory Cost = 3.75* * $\frac{n}{2}$ + *8.25* * $\frac{110}{n}$

In order to minimize this function, we will take its derivative:
$$f(n) = 3.75*\frac{n}{2} + 8.25 * \frac{110}{n}$$
$$f(n) = 1.875n +  \frac{907.5}{n}$$
$$f'(n) = 1.875 -  \frac{907.5}{n^2}$$
$$0 = 1.875 -  \frac{907.5}{n^2}$$
$$\frac{907.5}{n^2} = 1.875 $$
$$907.5 = 1.875(n^2) $$
$$484 = n^2 $$
$$n = 22$$

Subbing this back into our equations, we know that the number of orders per year to minimize inventory costs is: $\frac{110}{n} = \frac{110}{22} = 5$

## Problem 6
**Use integration by parts to solve the integral below:**
$$\int ln(9x) \cdot x^6dx$$

## Solution
Let $u=ln(9x)$, $du = \frac{1}{x}$, $v = \frac{1}{7}x^7$, and $dv = x^6$.
$$\int udv = uv- \int vdu$$
$$= ln(9x) \frac{1}{7}x^7 - \int \frac{1}{x} * \frac{1}{7}x^7 dx$$
$$= \frac{1}{7}ln(9x)x^7 - \frac{1}{7}\int \frac{x^7}{x} dx$$
$$= \frac{1}{7}ln(9x)x^7 - \frac{1}{7}\int x^6 dx$$
$$= \frac{1}{7}ln(9x)x^7 - \frac{1}{7} * \frac{1}{7}x^7 + C$$
$$= \frac{1}{7}ln(9x)x^7 - \frac{1}{49}x^7 + C$$

## Problem 7
**Determine whether $f(x)$ is a probability density function on the interval$[1,e^6]$. If not, determine the value of the definite integral.**
$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{6x}$$


## Solution
To satisfy the conditions of a probability density function, the total area within the bounds must be 1. 
$$\int_{1}^{e^6} \frac{1}{6x} dx $$
$$\frac{1}{6} \int_{1}^{e^6} \frac{1}{x}$$
$$\frac{1}{6} ln(x) |_{1}^{e^6}$$

$$\frac{1}{6} (6) - \frac{1}{6} (0) $$
$$= 1 $$

Yes, this is a probability density function.
