**Choose independently two numbers, $B$ and $C$, at random from the interval $[0,1]$ with uniform density. Prove that $B$ and $C$ are proper probability distributions. Note that the point $(B,C)$ is then chosen at random in the unit square.**  

``` {r}
B <- runif(1)
C <- runif(1)

B
C

```

**Find the probability that: **  

(a) $B + C < \frac{1}{2}$
``` {r}


```

(b) $BC < \frac{1}{2}$  
``` {r}


```


(c) $|B-C| < \frac{1}{2}$  
``` {r}


```


(d) $max\{B,C\} < \frac{1}{2}$  
``` {r}


```


(e) $min\{B,C\} < \frac{1}{2}$  
``` {r}


```
